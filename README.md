# Project Description

This is my first side-scrolling game written in C++ using the SDL2 libary.

The objective of the game is to save all the animals while trying to not get hit by the enemies.

What I learned:
  - Object oriented programming (OOP)
  - Basic game design
  - Handling memory leaks in C++
